          <h3>What these results mean to me</h3>
          <p>
            Some of these results reflect my behavior in some very minor aspects of my day-to-day life. For example, the Myers-Briggs test correctly predicted how I prefer to learn how to spell difficult words. When I was younger, I learnt how to spell beautiful through song, “Mr.B Mr.E Mr.AUT” iful, in a certain rhythm. The accuracy was pretty surprising. The learning style test has me put into action a new study plan to try and improve my study habits as I’d like to see myself get through content more efficiently – Shorter yet more frequent breaks. As for the creativity test I took, I struggle working with large amounts of information in one go which contradicts the result I got. I get overwhelmed relatively easily and wouldn’t consider that result entirely accurate, however, I would argue that the persistence aspect I scored high on is relatively accurate. I tend to have this urge to complete a task I’ve begun, irrelevant of time spent. For example, I was once working on coding a Vigenère Cipher, however, I was going about it logically and not through the mathematical equation which can be found on Wikipedia. I spent a solid 2 or 3 days trying to get it to work and having almost given up, I then read the Wikipedia page on it and discovered the equation which allowed me to solve the problem in about an hour at best.

          <h3>How my results influence my behaviour in a team</h3>
          <p>
            I would argue that the results reflect a fair portion of qualities that would be preferrable for teamwork. For instance, on the Mind section of the Myers-Briggs test I was considered an extravert. This means I enjoy working alongside other people and I’d argue it personally motivates my work ethic when people around me are also putting in 110%. My only concern is that according to the Myers-Briggs test, I prefer a structured plan with a detailed timeline. When working in a team, I may struggle to work alongside others if tasks are scattered and we lack a structured plan. In contrast, having the observant trait on the Myers-Briggs test means I’m more focused on what we would be working on as a team in the moment. I see myself as having relatively good attention to detail which I would consider an asset when working in a group. According to the learning style test, I have this aspect of flexibility due to being equally both a visual and a tactile learner. Furthermore, the creativity test claims I have the ‘persistence’ trait which resembles a strong work ethic. This could come in useful when working in a group as working around others can cause me to indirectly motivate others around me and vice versa as well.

          <h3>How I would take my results into account</h3>
          <p>
            When forming a team, I’d like others in my group to either balance or compliment my traits. So, my ability to be decisive, thorough, and attentive to details may come in useful at times, however, I may appreciate someone else in the group supporting my inability to look at the bigger picture of the task at hand. Moreover, persistence may be good, but I can see it causing some form of tunnel vision at times. Having frequent meetings discussing progress would be very useful to take a step back and analyze a situation to check whether or not progress has been efficient or if things need to be changed up. All in all, I’d like to see a fair balance of personality traits as I believe a diverse team would work best and complement each other’s talents.
