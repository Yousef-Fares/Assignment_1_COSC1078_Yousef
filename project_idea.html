          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            I’m planning on developing a board game application using the game engine Unity. Primarily, the application serves the purpose of entertaining the user, however, will also allow the user to socialize with others through some form of chat feature both privately and publicly. The idea is to allow people to play board games on a social platform that allows people to play through a selection of familiar board games. The board games would have to have familiar aesthetics to the in-person board games with similar, if not identical, rules. Users would also be allowed to customize their UI and have customizable characters to make conversations feel more real.

          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <p>
            After having done some research into the difference between the usage of social media pre-pandemic to today amongst millennials and Gen Z, I discovered there was a decent opportunity to invest on the sudden spike in users. According to an article by The Brussel Times<a class="reference" href="references.html">*14</a>, social media usage had increase by 78% based on a study, conducted by Anne-Gaëlle Sy a Content Manager for Sortlist UK, which researched how different generations were using social media during the pandemic. They also stated that users of social media were no longer just using it as a tool to interact with people online, but additionally, as a source of entertainment. So, taking this into account, creating an application dedicated to fulfilling both needs, social and entertainment needs, would serve to satisfy the consumer and potentially fill a gap in the social media market. Moreover, I’m extremely passionate about board games. I love the idea of coming together with friends and spending some time playing entertaining games. I’d like to replicate that through an online application simulating that very experience.

          <h3>Description</h3>
          <h5>Intro</h5>
          <p>
            As for the nitty gritty stuff, we will require the usage of Unity<a class="reference" href="references.html">*15</a>, a game engine, which utilizes the programming language C#. A free online Coursera.org course<a class="reference" href="references.html">*16</a> goes into detail how to utilize C# from beginner to advanced level in Unity. The application must have a catchy yet simple name that can attract users and represent what the key idea is. A signup and login system should be added to allow users to keep track of their progress and create profiles. We may require the implementation of some database management system, maybe SQLite <a class="reference" href="references.html">*17</a>, to store data on profiles and allow users to have unique experiences through customization. Customization should include various themes that the application’s UI could use, furthermore, themes may also be integrated into the board games themselves. The game would be a simple 2-Dimensional game where users are initially met with a menu page requesting a sign-in or sign-up option – people would ideally be 16+ to sign-up as younger people may not be as aware of online safety. Once the user performs that they would be met with a series of categories: friends, games, character, profile.
          </p>
          <h5>Friends</h5>
          <p>
            The ‘friends’ category would contain any group chats or private messages the user has. It would also allow users to search for profiles – to add, remove, or block – and allow users to access a requests section which would give users the opportunity to accept or decline any friendship requests or game invitations – people would appear on a friends list if both the player and user choose to become friends. A chat feature would include regular texting functions and the ability to tell when messages are sending, delivered, and read. A fun little addition to chats may be a user’s custom character being present during discussion as if they were contributing to the discussion and stickers purchased through an in-game currency feature.
          </p>
          <h5>Games</h5>
          <p>
            The ‘games’ category will initially allow users to enter a lobby and control their customized character. There would be a series of pavilions, each representing a different board game by their art style, where they would have to interact with the entrance of which to select. Once they select their desired game, they would be met with options to create a private or public session and to join a private or public session. Private sessions would require a unique code and passkey generated upon creation of the room. Users may invite players on their friends list to join a private lobby if they are the host. Furthermore, an events tab where events may take place which give players opportunities to complete a series of challenges to earn new custom items or a currency. Currency would only be earned by winning games or completing challenges in events.
          </p>
          <h5>Character</h5>
          <p>
            The ‘character’ category would display a simple character creation menu. The user, first time around, is presented with a default character that represents all the different customization features. Skin color would only consist of funky colors – palette of choice<a class="reference" href="references.html">*18</a>. Users would be given options of basic hair and facial features if they wished to include. Accessories and other items can be placed to spice up their looks, users can also earn new customizable by competing in events. A mini-shop section would allow users to spend the currency they earned on different outfits, accessories, hairstyles, themes, or stickers for use in chats.
          </p>
          <h5>Art Style</h5>
          <p>
            Finally, the art style would be some basic form of pixelated 2-Dimensional top-down art style. Top-down art is relatively common among 2-dimensional games of which relies on its color palette to determine the mood and ambiance the game is going for.

          <p>
            The Unity game engine<a class="reference" href="references.html">*15</a> created by Unity Technologies in 2005. It’s a free tool that I will utilize to code games on. Unity features development of some of the biggest games we know today, irrelevant of platform or dimensions, such as Pokémon Go, Cuphead, Escape from Tarkov, Fall Guys, Genshin Impact, SUPER MARIO RUN, etc. Moreover, I figured Pixilart<a class="reference" href="references.html">*19</a> is a great and costless way to design characters to be imported into Unity. It’s a free website that allows me to design pixelated characters with a grid for reference and download it to my desktop.

          <h3>Skills Required</h3>
          <p>
            In order to make this a reality, I would have to learn how to program in C#, although, I do have some of the basic syntax down. I have found an online course on Coursera.org<a class="reference" href="references.html">*16</a> which can be performed in about 10 hours which would support me in programming on Unity. It would be feasible but a bit demanding as I would also require some basic knowledge of drawing basic pixel art that could be acquired in an online 1-hour YouTube tutorial<a class="reference" href="references.html">*20</a>. The YouTube tutorial provides analysis into the top-down art style in 2-dimensional games as well as a look into building sprites for Unity<a class="reference" href="references.html">*21</a>.

          <h3>Outcome</h3>
          <p>
            The project’s purpose is to allow users to utilize a dedicated application to satisfy the ability to both interact online seamlessly and entertain themselves by playing games with friends using a library of game provides by us. If the project is successful, people will view the application as a platform to not just play games but also interact. People would ultimately feel more fulfilled during self-isolation. Friends with shared interests in board games could connect and potentially even form new friendships when facilitated by a shared interest of board games.
