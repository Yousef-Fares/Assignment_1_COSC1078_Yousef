          <h3>My interest in IT,<br>+ When and what sparked my interest</h3>
          <p>
          I’m most interested in the different applications of AI and would really like to build a career through it. Ever since June 2018, the summer of 2018 in the UAE, I have always been fascinated by Computer Science in general. It all stems from a vacation where my uncle working in the field introduced me to the concept of deep learning. He had a video up which demonstrated this deep learning thing creating a stickman by combining a bunch of predetermined sticks littered across the place on a paint file. I found this incredible and had to find out more, therefore, I decided I’d take some time to learn some coding and look into the field more – Mainly Python, some C++, some Java, and a little HTML. I didn’t come very far but I’ve always been set on building a career on something within IT.

          <h3>Why <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/" target="_blank">RMIT</a></h3>
          <p>
            The process of concluding RMIT wasn’t a very simple one. I was initially attending the University of Leeds<a class="reference" href="references.html">*5</a> for a semester online after having graduated with an American High School diploma from Turkey. They had then rolled out a new rule to have all students be present physically in Leeds during a very inconvenient time for me. The location alone wasn’t ideal as I have no friends or family located in the UK and visiting my family would be incredibly tedious and difficult. I had decided to look into other options and seeing as the semester timings in Australia work a little differently, I looked into options in Australia. After consulting some family located in Australia, I was recommended RMIT which stood out because my interest lies in tech. My first impression was the Student Connect team who were incredibly supportive and kind throughout the process of applying and receiving my offer. RMIT is also a lot more affordable for me and Melbourne is a far more convenient location. Being given the option to perform Semester 1 online has made my attendance possible. Lastly, I’m planning on coming physically during either Semester 2 or Year 2 of my studies.

          <h3>My expectations during my studies</h3>
          <p>
            I would really like to learn about different applications of AI as that’s where my interest in IT stems from altogether. I’m keen on moving forward with my career and I’d love to learn how to build a career around some application of AI. I’m also looking forward to building on my people skills and learn how to become more independent with not only studies but everyday routine too. I’d also like to see some form of work experience within IT being a part of the course as I believe nowadays it’s a necessity to begin building your experience.
